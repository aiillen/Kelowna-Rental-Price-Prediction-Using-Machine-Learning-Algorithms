I‚Äôm looking for a clean person who is responsible and respectful, who would be interested in living with group of like-minded people. We will be asking for a 3 month lease to start to make sure the living situation works for everyone with option to renew for a longer lease. No more pets are allowed  other than the 2 we have unfortunately.\n\nIf there are a lot of views on the page that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve rented out the room yet, ad will be removed when the room is filled.\nThe house utilities are 1 gigabit fibre optic internet, gas, electric, and water, Netflix(and other subscriptions) and come included in the rent cost. We also have a functioning fireplace and wood for house use.\n\nWhat you‚Äôll need ready: at least one reference and $350 security deposit to secure the room.\n\nA little about your future room-mates:\n\n March 1st there will be 2 females Barb 29 who works in healthcare and Angel 29 ,works in education. 3 males ,Jarrid 24 ,works in tech sector,  myself Dallon 31, works in tech sector and Cody 37 who works in healthcare. Most of us have jobs that require us to be up for work early in the morning, and generally there‚Äôs a laid back sense to the house. We all get along and enjoy hanging out but enjoy our privacy as well. We‚Äôre considerate people, open minded, fun and nerdy for the most part.\n\nAbout the house: \nThe house is 2500 sqft, and sits on a quarter acre property in a family area. Quigley Elementary school a few hundred feet away, and we‚Äôre 2-4 mins driving distance from a gym, 5 grocery stores, Costco, fast food, mission park creek, and 4 minutes away from Orchard Park mall. There are a few bus stops within 4-10 minutes walking distance.\nYou will need to bring a mattress and box spring, blankets, pillows, sheets etc, maybe a dresser if you have a lot of clothes, but the kitchen is fully set.\nThe house has central heating, washer and dryer, 2.5 bathrooms, 5 bedrooms, a covered garage, large back yard, garden and a covered deck. If you are a plant enthusiast we also have a indoor grow tent as well.  \n\nThe kitchen has 3 fridges, dishwasher, a gas range, and enough storage for everyone in the pantry, as well as a microwave. Anything you‚Äôll need for the kitchen is there. You‚Äôll share a fridge with 1 other person.\n\nWe have 2 chihuahua mix dogs Patrick and Odie. \nOn the deck we have a BBQ and some deck furniture and wood for our fireplace. \n\nThere is a cleaning system in place by the roomies, it‚Äôs negotiable if everyone agrees to a change to it, until that time its expected that you will participate in the system, and please note that being clean is a really important part of living here.\n\nAbout the available room -$700/month:\nWe are getting new carpet installed early February and painting so recent updates to your room will include that for when you move in (not currently shown in the picture). Its about 100sqft and has a closet as shown in the photos\n\nIf you got through all that and you think this will be a good fit for you send me a text at [hidden information], Cody. texts only, please leave a message if I don‚Äôt pick up, I will get back to you within 24 hrs.\n\nThanks for your time!

Three of the oversized bedrooms have conventional closets and the fourth is a master bedroom with a walk-in closet and ensuite. Attached is an oversized double bay garage that easily fits two SUV/trucks and still leaves enough room for storage. We have been parking our vehicles in the garage year round since building this home in 2017. There is in-floor heating in the garage, the ground level floor, and the upstairs bathrooms. The home is also equipped with air conditioning, a gas fireplace, gas BBQ hookup on rear deck, washer/dryer, dishwasher, granite countertops. All appliances are only a few years old, so everything is in great condition and works well. We have sound-proofed all walls and ceilings to create a quality living space. We also built this house very energy efficient. Our yearly average for utilities since building the home has been around $235/month. That is for water, electricity and natural gas.\n\nFor outdoor living, there are two large size decks (on the east & west side of the house). The East deck overlooks Swan Lake. All landscaping is irrigated and low maintenance. There is plenty of parking. In addition to the inside of the garage, there is room for 4 cars in the driveway and more in front of the retaining wall.\n\nWe are interested in a long-term tenant - as we are not intending to sell or move back into this home. We are looking for a tenant that can sign a 1+ year lease. \n\nNo drugs permitted on or in the property. No subletting - No using the property as an Airbnb. There is a high end legal suite rented separately to a very quiet professional lady. We are seeking clean, quiet, responsible tenants who will treat our home with care and respect. The suite is well sound proofed from the main part of the house and no duct work is shared. We can not hear the tenant. \n\nThe house is available right away.\nMonthly rent is $3650 + Utilities.\nWilling to consider pets.\nTenant insurance required.\nReference check is required.\nSecurity deposit is required.\nIf the add is up - it's available.\n\nIf you are interested, please respond with an introduction via Facebook messenger.

We couldn‚Äôt find someone to rent just u til February 15 (when we are back from having our baby)‚Ä¶ so currently have listed as a short term rental on Airbnb but it is less expensive to rent directly through us. We are looking for people  that will enjoy the home but whom are also incredibly trustworthy as we are leaving our fully furnished and decorated space (as well as many of our personal belongings) in their care in a vulnerable and exciting time in our life. Safety, care and trust are paramount to the environment in this house ! The home itself is beautifully appointed with everything you will need to comfortably enjoy your time there. It has one queen bed, another room with a double bed and a pullout queen bed (with an amazing comfortable 6 inch foamy to add on top). We also have a pack n‚Äôplay upon request. \n\nTo this end, we are looking for people  who are clean and sober and who will commit to no smoking of any kind (non negotiable), no drug use, and no illegal activity during their stay here.  While we have a drink occasionally after work if you like to party hard this is not the house for you as this is a family home and we have tenants upstairs who are trying to raise their child in a safe space.

Anything that seems relevant to me understanding who you are and how you would be as a roommate better would be nice. \n\nPet stuff: \nI have outdoor cats and a dog. We are pet friendly but hesitant to add and other furry friends. animals such as reptiles or caged animals are on a case by case basis. \n\nüçÉ friendly (outside only), we are social drinkers, not much for throwing parties but we do like to go out :) \nI‚Äôm an artist, I work from home in the art studio/ garage. My other roommates work in trades or as servers. We‚Äôre looking for roommates with steady income, students would fit in well also as we are close to UBCO and the bus will take you right there. Proof of income is required. \n\nplease message me with a bit about yourself and your situation, your work or income, your hobbies etc. \ni will be looking for proof of income, references, etc. I‚Äôm planning another open house so message me if you‚Äôre interested, date tbd. I can also send more pics of the home and we can do a video chat for a walk through instead of attending the open house if that works better for our schedules. \nThanks for taking the time to read this and good luck on your search. :) See less']",[],['https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/3473694982871945/?ref=category_feed&referral_code=undefined&referral_story_type=listing&tracking=%7B%22qid%22%3A%22-4747896950815960986%22%2C%22mf_story_key%22%3A%228458958947508264%22%2C%22commerce_rank_obj%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22target_id%5C%22%3A8458958947508264%2C%5C%22target_type%5C%22%3A0%2C%5C%22primary_position%5C%22%3A-1%2C%5C%22ranking_signature%5C%22%3A0%2C%5C%22commerce_channel%5C%22%3A504%2C%5C%22value%5C%22%3A-0.74147009144203%2C%5C%22candidate_retrieval_source_map%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%228458958947508264%5C%22%3A204%7D%7D%22%2C%22ftmd_400706%22%3A%22111112l%22%7D']
